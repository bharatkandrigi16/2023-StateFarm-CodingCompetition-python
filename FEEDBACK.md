    For running the unit tests and verifying execution: I had to move 'sample_data_tool.py' and the 'data' folder with 4 csv files into 'test' due to relative import errors.

    Added Flask imports and a 3rd party graphing library to visualize data using basic REST API endpoints.

    Just need to run the 'application.py' file to run the Flask app
